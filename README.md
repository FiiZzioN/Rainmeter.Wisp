#### Known Bugs!
-----------------------------------------------------------
When installing the skin or running the config app, Rainmeter becomes unresponsive and locks up. 

    Info about this bug:
        Thanks to H0rwood, I've found out that the config tool is causing the issue. 
        At this moment I'm not quite sure what's in the config that's causing this to happen.
        Currently, the workaround is to force close Rainmeter. After that you should be able to edit the 'SkinVariables.inc' file and then launch the apps individually.
    

-----------------------------------------------------------
#### Theme Help!
-----------------------------------------------------------
I've added themes for the current release. So far I have green, red, blue, and dark orange themes, but I'd like to add more.
If anyone's good with PS and your interested in helping make more themes, don't hesitate to contact me!
