If you're reading this, then thank you for downloading Wisp! 

Everything needed and seen in the screenshot is included in the downloaded file under the folder 'Suite AddOns'. This suite uses CoreTemp and MSI Afterburner to get all system information. 

To download CoreTemp click the 'CoreTemp' internet link that was included with the download under the folder 'Suite AddOns'. The download link should be a blue button reading 'Download'.

To download MSI Afterburner click the 'MSI Afterburner' internet link that was included with the download under the folder 'Suite AddOns'. The download link should be slightly to the left in a green arrow image reading 'Download MSI Afterburner'.

The wallpaper has been included with the download under the folder 'Suite AddOns' and is labled 'Wallpaper.png'.

If you want a wallpaper that has just the wooden panels, usually good for a secondary monitor, it's included in the 'Suite AddOns' folder and is labled 'Panels.png'.
